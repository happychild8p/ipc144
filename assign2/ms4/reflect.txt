findContactIndex() function was referred in searchContacts(), updateContacts(), and deleteContacts() function in order to find correct array index number via comparing cell phone number that user entered and stored cellphone number in the contacts structure type variable. Using strcmp() "string compare" function that is defined in the <string.h> library file to check the ASCII values in them. As we define findContactIndex() function, we did not need to re-type or use strcmp() function repeatedly in above three function, yet still able to find and perform action such as change the Contacts' information, search correct contacts information, or delete one contact. 
getTenDigitPhone() function scans user input and checks whether the length of user input has 10 character. When 10 characters have entered, it uses isdigit() function defined in <ctype.h> library to check each index of char array is integer value. Testing length and integer test, programmer or user do not need to check whether the input was valid or not for contacts[i].numbers.cell, home, and business.
Although programmer need to keep remember the relation of each source file (contacts.c, contactHelper.c) and how each function is used and the relation of functions as well, moduleing or creating functional contact management system assignment made me get ideas of how functional programming can be re-used and combined to work together. Especially instead of modifying codeblock in many different places but changing one function will reduce amount of work and efficiency.
